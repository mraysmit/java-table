# Java Table Improvement Tasks

## Architecture and Design
1. [x] Refactor Table class to use generics for type-safe operations instead of string-based type checking
2. [x] Implement a proper data model with separate classes for columns, rows, and cells
3. [x] Create interfaces for Table, Row, and Column to allow for different implementations
4. [x] Separate the CSV functionality into its own module with clear interfaces
5. [ ] Implement the Builder pattern for Table creation to improve readability and maintainability
6. [ ] Add support for more data types (Date, Time, etc.)
7. [ ] Implement a proper exception hierarchy for domain-specific errors
8. [ ] Refactor the relationship between Table and TableCore - currently Table is a wrapper around TableCore which creates unnecessary indirection
9. [ ] Consolidate duplicate code between Table and TableCore (e.g., originalDoubleStrings map exists in both)
10. [x] Improve the adapter pattern implementation - current adapters have inconsistent interfaces
11. [ ] Create a consistent strategy for handling data type conversions across the codebase
12. [ ] Implement a proper dependency injection mechanism instead of direct instantiation
13. [ ] Redesign the mapping framework to be more extensible and support complex transformations
14. [ ] Create a unified interface for all data sources (CSV, JSON, XML, JDBC)

## Code Quality
15. [x] Fix the bug in Table.addRow() where an exception is thrown after adding default values
16. [x] Remove duplicate condition check in Table.addRow() (line 36 and 39)
17. [ ] Make Table.columns final since it's initialized in the constructor
18. [ ] Add null checks in all public methods
19. [ ] Improve variable naming (e.g., 'columns' actually stores column types)
20. [ ] Add proper JavaDoc comments to all public methods and classes
21. [ ] Make CSVUtils methods handle quoted values and commas within fields
22. [ ] Implement proper error handling in CSVUtils instead of just printing stack traces
23. [ ] Add logging instead of using System.out.println() for debugging
24. [x] Make Table.inferType() more robust with better regex patterns
25. [ ] Fix inconsistent method naming (e.g., getValue vs getValueAt)
26. [ ] Remove unnecessary type casting and use generics properly
27. [ ] Fix the inconsistent handling of double values and string representations
28. [ ] Standardize error messages and exception handling across the codebase

## Performance
29. [ ] Optimize CSV reading for large files by using buffered streams

35. [ ] Optimize the Row and Cell implementations to reduce memory footprint
36. [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
37. [ ] Optimize the TableBuilder for better performance with large datasets

## Concurrent Collections Performance Considerations
38. [ ] Evaluate and choose appropriate collection types based on read-write ratios
39. [ ] Implement proper sizing strategies for concurrent collections to reduce resizing operations
40. [ ] Add batching mechanisms for operations to reduce contention
41. [ ] Implement partitioning strategies to reduce contention points
42. [ ] Add profiling support to identify bottlenecks in concurrent collection usage
43. [ ] Create benchmarks for different collection types with realistic workloads

## Testing
44. [x] Add tests for Table.inferType() method
45. [x] Add tests for Table.printTable() method
46. [x] Add tests for edge cases in Table.setColumns()
47. [x] Add tests for the createDefaultValue functionality
48. [ ] Add tests for handling quoted CSV values
49. [ ] Add tests for handling commas within quoted CSV values
50. [ ] Add tests for handling newlines within quoted CSV values
51. [ ] Add tests for error handling when files cannot be read or written
52. [x] Implement property-based testing for more robust test coverage
53. [ ] Add integration tests for the adapter implementations
54. [ ] Create performance benchmarks to measure improvements
55. [ ] Add tests for concurrent access to tables
56. [ ] Implement mutation testing to improve test quality
