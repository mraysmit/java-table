# Java Table Improvement Tasks

## Architecture and Design
1. [ ] Refactor the relationship between Table and TableCore - currently Table is a wrapper around TableCore which creates unnecessary indirection
2. [ ] Consolidate duplicate code between Table and TableCore (e.g., originalDoubleStrings map exists in both)
3. [ ] Improve the adapter pattern implementation - current adapters have inconsistent interfaces
4. [ ] Create a consistent strategy for handling data type conversions across the codebase
5. [ ] Implement a proper dependency injection mechanism instead of direct instantiation
6. [ ] Add support for more data types (Date, Time, etc.)
7. [ ] Implement a proper exception hierarchy for domain-specific errors
8. [ ] Redesign the mapping framework to be more extensible and support complex transformations
9. [ ] Create a unified interface for all data sources (CSV, JSON, XML, JDBC)

## Code Quality
1. [ ] Fix inconsistent method naming (e.g., getValue vs getValueAt)
2. [ ] Make Table.columns final since it's initialized in the constructor
3. [ ] Add null checks in all public methods
4. [ ] Improve variable naming (e.g., 'columns' actually stores column types)
5. [ ] Add proper JavaDoc comments to all public methods and classes
6. [ ] Make CSVUtils methods handle quoted values and commas within fields
7. [ ] Implement proper error handling in CSVUtils instead of just printing stack traces
8. [ ] Add logging instead of using System.out.println() for debugging
9. [ ] Make Table.inferType() more robust with better regex patterns
10. [ ] Remove unnecessary type casting and use generics properly
11. [ ] Fix the inconsistent handling of double values and string representations
12. [ ] Standardize error messages and exception handling across the codebase

## Performance
1. [ ] Optimize CSV reading for large files by using buffered streams
2. [ ] Implement lazy loading for large datasets
3. [ ] Add indexing capabilities for faster lookups
4. [ ] Optimize memory usage by using primitive collections where appropriate
5. [ ] Implement batch processing for large datasets
6. [ ] Add support for parallel processing of data
7. [ ] Optimize the Row and Cell implementations to reduce memory footprint
8. [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
9. [ ] Optimize the TableBuilder for better performance with large datasets

## Testing
1. [ ] Add tests for handling quoted CSV values
2. [ ] Add tests for handling commas within quoted CSV values
3. [ ] Add tests for handling newlines within quoted CSV values
4. [ ] Add tests for error handling when files cannot be read or written
5. [ ] Implement property-based testing for more robust test coverage
6. [ ] Add integration tests for the adapter implementations
7. [ ] Create performance benchmarks to measure improvements
8. [ ] Add tests for concurrent access to tables
9. [ ] Implement mutation testing to improve test quality

## Documentation
1. [ ] Create a comprehensive README.md with:
   - Project description
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage examples
   - API documentation
2. [ ] Add inline documentation for complex algorithms
3. [ ] Create user guides with examples
4. [ ] Document the CSV format supported by the application
5. [ ] Add contribution guidelines
6. [ ] Create Javadoc for all public APIs
7. [ ] Document the adapter pattern implementation and how to create new adapters
8. [ ] Create architecture diagrams showing the relationships between components

1. [ ] Add support for filtering and querying data
2. [ ] Implement sorting capabilities
3. [ ] Add support for data validation rules
4. [ ] Implement data transformation capabilities
5. [ ] Implement data visualization capabilities
6. [ ] Add support for database connectivity
7. [ ] Implement data export to various formats
8. [ ] Add support for schema validation
9. [ ] Implement change tracking and auditing
10. [ ] Add support for data aggregation and grouping operations

## Build and CI/CD
1. [ ] Update JUnit to the latest version
2. [ ] Add code coverage tools (JaCoCo)
3. [ ] Implement static code analysis (Checkstyle, PMD, SpotBugs)
4. [ ] Set up continuous integration
5. [ ] Add automated release process
6. [ ] Configure dependency management and updates
7. [ ] Add performance benchmarking
8. [ ] Implement automated API documentation generation
9. [ ] Set up containerization for consistent development environments

## Security
