# Analysis of CSVReader and FileConnection Interaction

After examining the code, I've identified several issues with the interaction between `IDataSourceConnection` and `FileConnection` in the CSV reading functionality:

## Current Issues

1. **Type Casting in `CSVReader.readData`**: 
   - Line 41 directly casts `IDataSourceConnection` to `FileConnection` without checking the type first
   - This will cause a `ClassCastException` if a different implementation of `IDataSourceConnection` is provided

2. **Redundant Type Check in `CSVReader.readFromCSV`**:
   - Lines 70-72 check if the connection is a `FileConnection`, which is redundant since the parameter is already declared as `FileConnection`

3. **File Path Extraction Logic**:
   - The method to extract the file path from `FileConnection` is overly complex
   - It handles remote and local connections differently
   - For local connections, it expects `getRawConnection()` to return a `String`, but `FileConnection.getRawConnection()` actually returns either a `URL` or a `Path` object

## Solution

The interaction between `IDataSourceConnection` and `FileConnection` needs to be fixed as follows:

1. **Fix the Type Casting in `CSVReader.readData`**:
   ```java
   // Replace line 41 with:
   if (!(connection instanceof FileConnection)) {
       throw new IllegalArgumentException("Connection must be a FileConnection");
   }
   FileConnection fileConnection = (FileConnection) connection;
   ```

2. **Remove Redundant Type Check in `readFromCSV`**:
   - Remove lines 70-72 since the parameter is already declared as `FileConnection`

3. **Improve File Path Extraction**:
   - `FileConnection` should provide a method that returns a usable file path string for `BufferedReader`
   - Add a method like `getFilePath()` to `FileConnection` that returns a string representation of the path

4. **Update `FileConnection.getRawConnection()`**:
   - Ensure it returns an object that can be properly used by consumers
   - If it returns a `Path` or `URL`, make sure consumers know how to handle these types

The `CSVProcessor` class correctly demonstrates how to use these classes together:
- It creates a `FileConnection` with the file name
- It calls `connection.connect()` to establish the connection
- It passes the connection to `csvReader.readFromCSV()`

This approach ensures proper separation of concerns and type safety when working with CSV files.
